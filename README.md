Generating synthetic sensor data and analyzing it using machine learning models. It covers linear motion and rotational motion data simulation, noise addition, and classification using Random Forests. Additionally, it includes data augmentation using Tabular GAN and synthetic data generation using Conditional GAN (CGAN).


Sensor data refers to the information collected by sensors, which are devices that detect and measure physical properties such as temperature, pressure, motion, and light. In the context of this repository, we focus on data from accelerometers and gyroscopes:
- Accelerometers: Measure acceleration forces that may be static (like gravity) or dynamic (like movement or vibrations).
- Gyroscopes: Measure rotational motion and orientation.

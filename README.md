# Introduction
This repository contains code for generating synthetic sensor data and analyzing it using machine learning models. It covers linear motion and rotational motion data simulation, noise addition, and classification using Random Forests. Additionally, it includes data augmentation using Tabular GAN and synthetic data generation using Conditional GAN (CGAN).

# What is Sensor Data?
Sensor data refers to the information collected by sensors, which are devices that detect and measure physical properties such as temperature, pressure, motion, and light. In the context of this repository, we focus on data from accelerometers and gyroscopes:
- Accelerometers: Measure acceleration forces that may be static (like gravity) or dynamic (like movement or vibrations).
- Gyroscopes: Measure rotational motion and orientation.

#Why is This Code Helpful?
- Synthetic Data Generation: Creating synthetic data helps simulate various scenarios and conditions without the need for extensive data collection processes.
- Noise Simulation: Adding noise to sensor data makes it more realistic, reflecting the imperfections in real-world sensor measurements.
- Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating machine learning models on synthetic data can help in developing robust algorithms for real-world applications.
= Data Augmentation: Using techniques like Tabular GAN to augment data can improve model performance by providing a richer dataset.
- Synthetic Data for Testing: CGAN can generate synthetic data for testing purposes, which is valuable when real data is scarce or difficult to obtain.
